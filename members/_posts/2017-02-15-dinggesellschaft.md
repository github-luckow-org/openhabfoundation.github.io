The Ding Gesellschaft is a Berlin-based company sophisticated in securing, extending and advancing IoT networks. Our goal is to create intelligent solutions for intelligent beings.

We support our B2B clients from scratch and take them beyond imagination. By enabling them to use machine learning we improve user experience and optimize their setup.

Open Source software and systems are important to us, so we put a lot of effort in community-building and Open Source evangelism.
